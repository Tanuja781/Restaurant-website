# Restaurant-website
The Restaurant Website Project titled “Savory Scrolls & Sizzle Spots” is a modern, responsive web application designed to showcase a restaurant’s brand, menu, and services in an engaging way. The website uses HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface suitable for all devices.

The homepage starts with a fixed custom navigation bar, ensuring smooth navigation across pages like menu, reservation, and about sections. The hero section features a full-screen background with a bold restaurant name, a tagline, and call-to-action buttons for viewing the menu and making reservations, which immediately captures user attention.

The Featured Dishes section highlights the restaurant’s signature items with images, descriptions, and prices arranged in a responsive grid layout. This helps customers quickly explore popular offerings. The About section presents the restaurant’s story, background, and chef expertise, building trust and emotional connection with visitors.

Customer feedback is displayed in the Testimonials section, where reviews, ratings, and customer images enhance credibility and showcase service quality. A reservation call-to-action section encourages users to book a table, improving customer engagement and conversions.

The website concludes with a detailed footer containing contact information, operating hours, location details, and social media links, making communication easy for customers. Feather icons are used for a clean and modern visual appearance.

Overall, this project demonstrates an effective restaurant website that combines aesthetics, functionality, and responsiveness. It serves as a strong digital platform for promoting the restaurant, attracting customers, and improving online presence.
